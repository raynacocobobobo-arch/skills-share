Well, things are heating up in the
creative AI space. We've got a lot to
cover today, including a big update in
real-time AI video, some C dance seed
news, a quick check-in with our friends
over at Martini going over their new
camera control feature, and a really
interesting new workflow that I think
you're going to want to check out.
Kicking off, Deckard recently dropped
Lucy 2.5. This is the latest rev of
their real-time video model. This one
edits video live at 1080p 30 frames a
second with near zero latency. Now, as a
quick note, this language always bothers
me. Obviously, this isn't actually
editing the video in the traditional
like non-linear editing sense, but
rather it's doing the work of like the
effects or compositing on top of the
video. Not to say that any of this is
any less impressive. I just I know that
there are a few of us out there that
always kind of bristle when we hear
video editing in this context. But
again, Lucy 2.5 is pretty impressive. As
you can like swap a character, restyle
the scene, drop in VFX or remove objects
all midstream driven by text prompts and
reference images. The way this works is
what Deckard is calling self-anchoring.
So, the model adapts to its own
generated output as the new reference
point, which is how we avoid everything
like devolving into Bobby face people or
like insane psychedelic nightmares.
Granted, are there sane psychedelic
nightmares? I mean, I've never had one.
If you have, let me know in the
comments. In the meantime, let's go
ahead over to Deckard where they've set
up a playground for us to try out Lucy
2.5. And actually, good news outside of
the playground as well when it comes to
pricing. So, yeah, it's always weird
being on this camera. But as we can see,
I am now an animated character.
There's a couple of presets down here as
well, like hair on fire. Let's try that.
Yeah, hey, wow. I did need a haircut
anyways, but now like we're still flame
thrower girl.
You can reference
other things. That's actually the thing
that interests me the most. Let's toss
in Renfield here and say
change the man to the attached reference
character. Let's see how this ends up
looking.
Um
So, is that fire? Yeah, there is. So,
yeah, there I am. Now, I'm Renfield.
Um
Pretty good. There's a little bit of
blurring down here. What is Oh, you know
what that might be? That might be
because of the microphone, I wonder.
Um Yeah, it's always interesting seeing
uh how these characters react. He's a
little
like I don't know.
The
I got to work on how you act in AI
restylizations. So, currently the
easiest way to access Lucy 2.5 is via
this playground. Although it is again
available via API. I did not see an app
version of this yet. That was the thing
that was kind of showcased in the demo
with this guy walking around with his
phone and you know, editing things on
the fly. But in good news, although you
know, the app version doesn't exist, it
looks like you might actually be able to
build one since the API cost for this at
least at 720 uh appear to be 2 cents a
second. So, I mean, that's pretty great.
Considering that generation costs for
everything have been skyrocketing. To be
honest, you know, costs for everything
have been skyrocketing. Uh 2 cents a
second, that is refreshing news. So,
I'll definitely be keeping an eye on
this one. I do think that one like
potential use case for Lucy 2.5 is to
treat it like live previews where you
can you know, shoot something on your
phone and then you know, take it through
a video-to-video model, say like
obviously SeaDance 2.0 or 2.5 for a
final render pass. And again,
considering that the API is available, I
mean, this is something that you know,
potentially someone brave enough out
there might be able to tackle on their
own. I mean, I'd give it a shot, but I
am super low on Fable 5 tokens right now
and I have not gotten access to Kimmy K3
yet. Moving on, we are all still on Sea
Dance 2.5 watch. No release date as of
yet, but samples kind of continue to
trickle out. Here is the latest.
I mean, overall, I think this is a
pretty cool output. It was posted up
over on Bilibili, so big meow to our
viewers over there.
Um, I mean, again, overall, I kind of
really like this output. I dig that like
late '70s, early '80s vibe that it has
going on, very Blues Brothers-esque. The
crash looks really good. Yeah, there is
some water that sprays up there
seemingly out of nowhere, but I yeah,
kind of works. Um, you know, overall, I
think it looks good. There are There is,
of course, stuff to nitpick. I don't
think I'm being overly critical, but
there is like a phantom car that appears
over here. Another point is that as
these two cars crash, I mean, in in
terms of like real-world physics,
obviously, that car that was behind them
would definitely crash into them as
well. So, there is that as well. Again,
a lot of this might be splitting hairs,
but also might be the reason that it is
delayed a bit longer. Look, if you think
that this output looks amazing, that's
fantastic. If you think it needed more
work, well, again, I mean, I think
that's what the delay is about.
Obviously, my eyes are peeled, and I
will let you know as soon as I hear
anything about a release date. Worth a
quick sidebar while we're in the Sea
Dance section, uh, director Neill
Blomkamp of District 9, Elysium, and
Chappie fame, I guess. And well,
actually, to me, the, uh, the greatest
unmated alien movie. Well, he has
released a short film created with C-DaS
2.0. Uh you can watch it now. The link
is down below. I also did want to let
you guys know I am starting to hear a
lot more about a C-DaS level model that
is waiting in the wings. I mean, yes, on
the one hand it is kind of like a
no-brainer, but I have spoken with a few
people who tell me that they have seen
it. They can't really say much more than
yes, they have seen it. It's very good
and it should be here soon. So, yes,
while you can file this news under
nothingburger, I did just want to kind
of put it out there as yeah, there's
definitely been a lot more concern
lately uh about ByteDance essentially
dominating everything and probably could
use some competition, which you know, I
mean, it always helps with pricing.
Speaking of ByteDance completely
crushing it in just about every area, um
we recently covered Seed 1.0, the audio
generator. Uh yet, it is very good.
Interestingly, Byte just released an
update. It's not really an update. Like,
this isn't a 1.1. It is still 1.0, but
improvements have been made, including
timing generations and the ability to
pin dialogue to exact times. Uh you
know, basically more control. Take a
quick listen and actually a look as
well.
>> Wait a minute. Why do I have an Indian
accent?
>> Isn't that what you wrote in the script?
And you're going to get hit in 3, 2, 1.
Then Hawk shows up and says,
>> Watch out.
>> Gate 7 is closing. Bring it through.
>> Copy.
Don't look around. Just keep walking.
>> Easy, man. We ain't missing this flight.
>> I have to say,
this feels way too real.
>> It's only the beginning.
>> Remember, kids, sound is half your
picture. Moving on, we're going to take
a look at an experimental video
generation workflow that I think you're
going to find pretty interesting. But,
first we're going to head over to
Martini to check out some of their
latest features. That part of the video
is sponsored, but as always Martini is
super chill, which is also the best way
to drink one. So, no hard sell here.
Moving over to a visit with our friends
at Martini, who were kind enough to
sponsor today's video and at me maybe
buy you a drink. I'll I'll tell we'll
talk about that in a little bit. Now, if
you've been following the channel for a
while, you know that I've covered
Martini a few times in the past and
well, they have been busy at work with
some new features for us. But the big
recent one is camera motion and this one
kind of builds off of the step into set
feature. Uh camera motion allows you to
literally control your camera movements
in an image to video generation. So, the
way this works is pretty neat. Uh we
have this image of flamethrower girl
here standing in front of the meta
building.
Um we use this in a thumbnail uh a few
videos back. Um come up to your three
dots up here and then um we want to step
into set and then camera motion. From
there it kind of opens up into like a
Gaussian splat sort of thing. Um you'll
notice that you can change your uh focal
length up here, your lens length rather.
Um and then we have its timeline down
here. So, if we if we if we scrub down
the timeline a little bit, you can add a
keyframe in. So, um let's go ahead and
add a key Well, okay, hang on. Let's
see. Let's move her around uh or move
the camera around. So, WASD keys move
the camera around and then your mouse um
you know, just kind of places where you
want the camera. Um from here we just
add a keyframe in and now you'll see the
the keyframe has appeared. We can
actually slide the keyframe down if we
want to. Um
if you grab a hold of it uh those little
arrows right there. Um and then we have
a uh like motion intensity, some options
on that. I just generally leave it on
this one. Um but if we scroll back to
the beginning, you'll see up we're at
the end. Um if you scroll back to the
beginning, you'll see now we have our
movement applied. Uh and you can add
multiple keyframes in, too. So, if you
wanted to um say get really wacky with
it, uh you can. So, um add another
keyframe in a really short This is going
to be a bit of a mess, but uh we'll see.
So, um as you can see and then should
snap over that way. So, yeah,
obviously, you know, you just control
the camera.
When you're happy with what you got, you
just hit save camera move and then that
will repopulate over here in which we
have our motion control or motion camera
over here along with our start frame
and then ingredients essentially, you
know, elements
audio as well. You can throw in like a
seed 1.0 audio file if you want to. And
then prompt box down here. Obviously,
this is generating in C and S 2.0. So,
this is just kind of a silly test that I
ended up putting together with that with
camera movement that makes no sense and
a prompt that just says, "She's
laughing."
>> [laughter]
>> We're moving.
>> What I like about this new feature is
there's just a lot of different ways to
approach it. For example, taking our
crew cabin quarters from a spaceship. I
think we've used this one before and we
can add in our crew member as an element
and then just, you know, have her walk
in the room and sit down on the bed.
Now, is this the greatest of camera
moves for this particular shot? Not
really, but it just again, it just sort
of opens up a door
to create a workflow in which you are
actually plotting out your camera move
before your actors even step on the set
your virtual actors and your virtual
set. And what's cool is that Martini's
not even done cooking on this one yet.
There's an upcoming ability to be able
to use your phone as a motion controller
as well. So, that's pretty awesome. The
other and I'll admit kind of like not
necessarily mind-blowing game-changing
feature recently introduced, but also
super necessary and I think an extremely
helpful quality of life feature
and again, particularly since Martini is
canvas based is that they've introduced
the the idea of a library. And look, I
know it probably does not seem like that
big a deal and I'm actually just getting
started with putting stuff together
here, but um, know, obviously, we can
put together a library for flamethrower
girl. And that means that any canvas
that I later visit or any other project
that I'm in in Martini, I can have
access to all of my flamethrower girl
media. Um, so, you know, and obviously
you can build that out for characters or
locations or what whatever else you
need. Uh, the other kind of cool part,
if you're into the whole MCP thing, uh,
you can just pop into something like
Claude and say something like, uh, you
know, hop into my library and place the
image of flamethrower girl with her
flamethrower on the canvas of a new
project. Oh, look, it's another Claude
update. It was shocking. And now my
little minion has done its job. Uh, you
know, I know this seems pretty stupid
right now, but I think that when you
start getting like building up a pretty
substantial library, this could come in
very handy. And the Martini team is not
even done. They're still shaking or
stirring. Uh, so, if you want to check
them out, they have been kind enough to
offer you guys, uh, viewers of this
channel 50% off your first month of
subscription. So, just hit the link
below and enjoy your Martini. Moving on,
I ran across a pretty new interesting
technique from Oak. Essentially, the
idea here is to utilize depth maps as
your storyboard uh, layouts uh, instead
of like traditional like, you know,
storyboard traditional uh, generated uh,
storyboard frames. So, the idea here is
that again, uh, you know, we have a nine
panel grid here uh, that takes the place
of depth maps and that's referencing
your characters and I guess just one
image that kind of defines the look. I I
think this works pretty well. Uh, it
definitely retains that kind of like 80s
like late 80s like dark fantasy kind of
vibe to it. Very like Henson-esque dark
crystally, uh, but also by way of um,
like Drizzt, I want to say. Uh, dark elf
sneaky archer kind of thing. Yeah, this
is very cool. Now, I think it is
important to note that these are not
actual depth maps. These are well, GPT
images idea of depth maps. So, much like
we've seen when we give like Nano Banana
or image one like, you know, make me a,
you know, Blender UI. It's kind of
there, but it's kind of not. So, these
are not really truly depth maps.
So, it is hard to say if how much effect
this has. So, I was curious to see how
this would perform with an actual depth
map. And then additionally, I
remembered, oh yeah, I built a tool for
that. Yeah, a few videos back I made
theoretically pose V4
and release that link to that will be
down below. Actually, as I was going
through this one I for V5 one of the
things I need to do is just be able to
put in an a still image and get a depth
map from that. So, regardless, taking
this and then utilizing it essentially
with the same prompt and same references
flamethrower girl and the location
itself and then just saying to you
reference video one as essentially the
the depth reference. We ended up I mean
I don't know what I was thinking, but
essentially it was it kind of looks
exactly the same. It looks exactly the
same until you compare them back to
back. I'll fully admit it is definitely
very subtle, but I mean it's there. The
characters in the foreground look much
more separated from the background and
you know, the again the overall color
palette has changed I think to its
benefit. Now, I did want to continue on
and experiment around more with this,
but C-Dance has been acting a little
funky lately.
Mostly likely due to the imminent
release or testing or GPU allocation to
C-Dance 2.5. So, yeah, I'm I'm going to
bench this experiment for 2.5, but I
would say for sure,
I mean give the whole depth map thing a
shot. If you want the link to the pose
control thing is down below along with
the whole video that explains it. Final
admin notes, yes, I am aware I do need a
haircut. I think this is going to be a
pretty busy week, so I do not think that
I'm going to have time to go out and get
one. Mostly what I'm trying to say is I
will see you again very soon. As always,
I thank you for watching. My name is
Tim.
