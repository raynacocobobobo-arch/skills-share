So, I know everyone is waiting on news
about Stable Diffusion 2.5 and I've got
a little bit on that, but overall, I
thought today would be a good day to
check in on a roundup of everything else
that's going on. But, I do have some new
Stable Diffusion 2.5 examples to check
out as well. Plus, you know, hands-on
tests and quick hits for the balloon
view on everything else. All right,
let's hop in.
Kicking off, yeah, sadly, like no big
Stable Diffusion 2.5 release as of yet.
But, in the meantime, ByteDance have
released SeaDream 5.0 Pro. We're going
to see how many times I screw up and say
dance in this video. This is another one
in kind of our thinking image model
category. It does have a few interesting
tricks, kind of. At baseline, we are, of
course, looking at image generation with
native text support. They say that it
handles complex information
visualization, so, you know, kind of
infographic-y thing, accurately
transforming data concepts and dense
text into professional layouts.
Interestingly, additionally, it takes up
to 10 reference images, which I think
does beat nano banana. Now, there are
definitely some unique features here,
including interactive precision editing,
where you can use like a lasso or point
selection, sketch rendering, and and
whatnot, and layer separation. Although,
although, we're going to take a look at
that in a minute. I'll say the whole
concept of layers with in generating
within layers was probably the most
exciting thing about it. Is it like that
kind of system really allows you to lock
in your compositions, but that feature
is, I mean, not quite fully baked, as
we'll see in a minute. So, in the
meantime, let's just take a look at the
model as a standalone. And I I mean,
look, I'm going to be straightforward.
I'm kind of on this part. Kicking off
with our old chestnut, a man in a blue
business suit walking down a busy city
street. This it does generate in 4K,
that's what this image is, so that's
pretty nice. And I think at first
glance, everything looks, you know,
maybe a little bit bland, but I would
say we got what we asked for here, and
you know, it's definitely not the most
bland generation of the man in the blue
business suit. Um city details all look
very nice. There's actually not I mean,
I don't have a ton to complain about
until you punch in. The problem is that
once you kind of zoom in on some of the
details of the image, uh we do see the
return of the blobby face people. Uh
even uh you know, our man in the blue
business suit. Not full blob, uh but you
know, it's like he's on his way to the
blob transformation. Should be an AI
horror movie about the blobby face
people. Um so yeah, that you know, that
is
pretty disappointing though. And
unfortunately, it wasn't just limited to
that generation. On a subsequent
re-roll, again, you know, pretty similar
same prompt. I was like, "Oh, see the
see Dream Weaving pretty smart there. Uh
you got your man in the blue business
suit faced away from us as well as a
bunch of other people to keep the blobby
face people away." But we do have a
couple of folks over here. When you
punch in on them, yep, uh we get our
blobby face people. I And of course, we
do get some like trademarky stuff up
here. Starbucks, obviously CVS. Uh I
don't know what this is. Is that
Roscoe's?
Oh, no, it's not Roscoe's. Is it Was it
Nando's? I I haven't had I I've not
actually eaten at Nando's yet. I really
do want to try it. Um but yeah, so
overall, uh you know, kind of a mixed
bag here. Another example here.
Actually, this one not too bad. Prompt
on screen. Uh this one we ran in the um
Muse video just a little while back. The
This is a prompt by Fopher, someone who
probably has eaten at a Nando's because
he is from the UK. Um this I you know,
honestly, this one didn't come out too
bad. I was actually pretty happy with
this. Again, uh everything in here all
The reason that we run this particular
prompt is to see, you know, how much
detail uh in the prompt that the model
is picking up with very identifiable
landmarks uh such as the blue walls, the
red carpet, the white wicker furniture,
uh the I don't know, like 80s-ish
computer eight like late 80s, early 90s.
Um it looks more like I don't know. To
me, it kind of looks a little like
mid-80s. To be honest, I'm not I'm not
really going to complain about this one.
My next test was with references. And
admittedly, I did not go ham here. I
didn't put like 10 images in there as
you can just cuz I didn't feel like
Where's Waldo-ing all the references.
So, it really was just two. It was this
location. And then because I had, you
know, some images available of of these
guys, I used the Oni guys from Dragon
Blue. Everybody, you know, we we
constantly use flamethrower girl from
that film. So, I figured give it up to
these these hardworking stuntmen. The
resulting image was this. Again, I
didn't go crazy with putting them into
elaborate poses or anything like that.
It was just really just put these
characters into this environment. And
overall, I mean, I think it came out
pretty good.
Kind of ends up looking like
uh if Blade Runner 2049 was directed by
Quentin Tarantino. That is a movie I'd
watch. To be fair, you can take the
words Blade Runner directed by and then
follow it with any name and I'm still
I'm going to watch it. Now, where I did
begin to run into some real weaknesses
was with using flamethrower girl
actually in her jungle girl adventure
outfit. Um you know, this should be a
pretty simple prompt, just her with her
flamethrower in a jungle. Um and while
this one's kind of passable, I mean, I
do feel that her face is kind of losing
a little bit of character identity
there. But, I would also run into shots
like this, which not only is, you know,
wrong, but looks incredibly painful as
well. I also ended up with this one
which kind of created a shoulder-mounted
flamethrower unit, which
again, not what I was looking for, but
now that I'm thinking about it, actually
is kind of cool. So, after tuning up the
prompt a little bit, I ended up with
outputs like this, which
you know, on the one hand, they're not
necessarily bad. They're just kind of
bland. I mean, from a technical
standpoint, there's nothing much really
to complain about in this output. You
know, she's consistent with the lighting
in the jungle. We do have the accurate
flamethrower here. She does appear to
have you know, four fingers and a thumb.
Character model is done very well as
well, even down to the sort of tattoos
here, which she has in this version in
the jungle girl adventure outfit.
Yeah, but I mean at the same time it's
just it's kind of just not an inspiring
image. Although to its credit, I do
think that it does a really good job
with like these medium close-up type
shots. Another example of that
obviously, you know, referencing Ridley
Scott like you know, early 80s sci-fi
horror.
Yeah, I mean this is the kind of stuff
that I do think that the model does very
well. And in particular I think that
probably when you combine a frame like
this
and add the movement into see
dance
that you're going to get a pretty good
output. Model does seem to have a very
good handle on
film genres and styles as well. For
example, you know, here with very
Italian Giallo, you know, Dario Argento
Suspiria kind of vibe.
Overall, what I think it does really
well is environments. That's one thing
that I do think that this model does
like a really fantastic job with.
Characters, poses, figures,
kind of kind of mid on that. And again,
playing around with it you can end up
with some pretty interesting stylistic
images. Like this was
I think like Wong Kar-wai film by way of
cyberpunk. I think that this I think
this is like a cool looking image. Um
Now, if you want to edit anything and
well, this is the part that kind of gets
a little bit on the frustrating side.
So, one of the things that in like the
marketing materials it made it look like
is that you could take an image like
this and like click a button and then
like all the layers would like just auto
layer everything they would explode out
and you can kind of play with it. That
that that's not it at all. In fact,
actually I found this to be a fairly
frustrating experience. This is over on
Dreamina
where I think that
is the only place that maybe has this
editing function. I did not see it
available via the API. Some of the other
stuff like drawing was, but I didn't see
the layer stuff in there. So, your layer
controls are over here. And you know,
you can do some it's a lot of like brush
based kind of stuff. Um so I think that
if you right-click on it, you can do
things like arrange layers, flip it,
etc., etc. Um there is an ability to
delete layers as well. It It's just a
little like where is everything is kind
of the idea. Oh, here's remove
background here. So my initial like
foray into this was like um you know,
adding a new layer in and then
generating up an image of like a
cyberpunk cab flying through the street.
Um the problem Well, two problems here
is that one, uh this image is obviously
not at all related to uh our base image.
So it doesn't have any contextual
wearing of of what it's generating into.
Um two, I don't know for whatever reason
it's it's image three and image 3.1 that
are available as the {quote} inpainting
models. Um so yeah, not great. Um so I
mean even in a situation like this, um
you know, we can hit remove background
and it does this really weird thing
where it does uh like the checkerboard
transparency on the foreground object.
I've actually never like it it looked
really backwards and I you know, so I
rolled the dice and I hit remove
background um and it it does remove the
background. It just feels like like the
masking idea is flipped. I I don't it's
really it's really an odd choice.
Obviously once it's in there, we can,
you know, place it wherever, but again,
it perspective-wise it's it's in the
wrong it's in the wrong place. Um so
from there, I decided to take uh well,
this image of flamethrower girl that we
generated up in the Meta Muse video.
This was just an an example. Once again,
repeated the process of uh removing the
background from her, which I think it
does actually a pretty good job with
that. Um you know, we can figure out a
spot for her. So let's put her here, for
example. And then if we try to um then
take this into uh we'll do image to
image, which I think repopulates. So
that repopulates with our image here. Um
and then simply enter our prompt.
Relight the scene so that the woman in
the foreground matches the color and
lighting of the environment. I mean,
pretty basic prompt. Um,
turn up the intensity or whatever. A lot
of this doesn't matter cuz well, you'll
see. Uh, and then let's set it to edge.
Why not? Um, sure. Cuz you hit generate
and what ends up happening is, um, well,
watch this actually work this time cuz
it wasn't working pretty much all day
long. So, we'll see what I Oh, there it
is. So, yeah, couldn't generate. Um, did
get refunded three credits though. So,
yeah, um,
bit of a problem there. So, yeah, I
mean, overall, I mean, I I do hope that
ByteDance can get this one up to speed.
They're basically dominating in every
other area, but for some reason image is
one place they have like traditionally
been lagging. Now, I do think that that
if they do manage to get the editor
really up and humming and probably using
the, uh, 5.0 pro model to do its
inpainting, outpainting, and composition
blending, uh, you know, this could be a
very interesting addition to GPT image
two and, uh, Nano Banana two and well,
more for me Nano Banana Pro. Um, but,
you know, as it stands right now, it's
kind of a mess. That said, let's let's
remember that SeaArt's 1.0 was also not
very good. Speaking of which and moving
on to some quick SeaArt's 2.5 news.
Maybe not the greatest of news, um, but
it does look like the release has yet
again been delayed till at least July
20th. That said, in the meantime, we do
have a few new samples that have leaked
out. Um, these are focusing on one-shot
camera output. So, uh, let's take a look
at some of those.
>> Please have your two strangers and we
have sent this to your
stations and
>> [music]
[crying and gasps]
>> You're really here.
You're actually here.
>> How many times do you think this guy
stood her up at the train station for
her to have that reaction? Like, you're
here, you're actually here. I I'm
guessing at least three. Um, you know,
overall, I think it's it's it's, you
know, definitely a very nice C dance
generation, uh, nice camera movement and
everything. Very does very much have
like a C dance look. Uh, 30 seconds. Um,
you know, compression-wise, it might
look a little on the crunchy side. You
are looking at, uh, you know, a
compressed video that has now, once
again, via YouTube been compressed. So,
yeah, it might look a little bit on the
crunchy side. There is a little bit of
like, I don't know, kind of a fast frame
rate thing happening. So, I don't know
if this has been upscaled to like 60 FPS
or anything. Um, but yeah, there is
something a little bit off, uh, about,
again, the frame rate. Another example
close to my heart cuz I just finished
watching The Bear.
>> TABLE NINE, LET'S GO. I need it hot. Two
minutes, Chef.
>> Overall, I think the, uh, scallop looks
delicious there. Chef almost loses his,
uh, eyebrow. Um, but, you know, as a
holistic generation, a lot of really
great camera movement in the beginning.
Um, some, you know, dynamic acting here.
Um, yeah, I mean, I think it this looks
very promising. Now, one reason,
possibly, that, uh, 2.5 is held up,
well, resides in this next example.
>> We made it.
I really didn't think we would.
>> That is one of those scenes that I mean,
you can't really place. Is that the very
end of the movie or the very beginning
of the movie then we move into
flashback. Either way, that movie is
starring Andrew Garfield.
>> Editor Tim breaking in here
just as I was editing this video. My dad
decided to drop an official
short film
utilizing C-Dance 2.0 because of course
they did. Audio muted here cuz I don't
know the source of the music that's
playing under it. It's a short film that
sort of details the 1988 World Cup goal
that Michael Owen scored against
Argentina. So, you know, very much
queuing in on footy fever. You know,
overall, it's a really nice little you
know, short. Although, I will say that
if you are paying close attention,
visually there you know, it is not
necessarily perfect. This is something
that I've been kind of poking at a
little bit and look, I'm not not bagging
on it at all. I'm you know, C-Dance 2
and clearly 2.5. They These are the best
video models in the world right now.
But, that does not mean that they aren't
necessarily going to be prone to some
physics problems here and there or
actually I spotted a couple of like
little weird morphs in here as well.
But, you know, again, overall the story
is what matters. Link to the full video
with audio will be down below. Is it
just me or did the whole thing also kind
of have a bit of that like GPT image to
grain to it. Let me know what you think
down in the comments. Next up, we're
going real-time, but first a actually a
very short word about my upcoming live
session. So, the fine folks at Teachable
have been running an AI Academy, and
there's already a number of sessions up
and a few more upcoming, including my
pal YouTube's own Matt Wolfe. Some more
news on this in a minute, but here's
something I think it you might find
interesting. You know, one question I do
get asked a lot is how do you keep up
with everything in the creative chat AI
space when the ground keeps shifting.
Well, at least one trick I like to use
is our recurring characters. The man in
the blue business suit, our FBI agent
drinking coffee at a Pacific Northwest
diner, and of course fan favorite
flamethrower girl. You know, having
these characters as cornerstones, one of
whom may or may not be trying to take
over the channel. Well, I mean, it
really does let me eyeball very quickly
how a new model is reacting under stress
tests to like these quantifiable
characters that we all know. Plus, I
mean, it is just really fun to have a
roster of oddball characters to hang out
with on the channel. And I'm happy to
say that is just one of the insights
I'll be sharing in my own AI Academy
session at Teachable for a full 1-hour
live stream session. You can sign up at
the link down below, and no, I mean, I'm
not ruling out that flamethrower girl is
going to sub in. Uh my thanks to the
folks at Teachable for sponsoring
today's video and the upcoming live
session. Hope to see you there. Moving
on world of real-time video generation.
Uh again, kind of the benchmark here is
like Genie 3. At this point, we have
seen a few of these released open
source, and we have a new one, and it's
pretty impressive. Uh this is Ling Bot
World 2.0. Pretty sure that we looked at
uh
World 1.0, I think. Uh this is from
Reactor. Um weights are available over
on Hugging Face. I do think that it's
probably pretty beefy. I haven't
actually looked into that part of it.
But yeah, this one kind of operates in
sort of that hybrid space of like a
genie three type thing and a bit like um
what's the last one we looked at? Oh,
happy oyster. Man, they're all starting
to bleed together. Where you kind of
have, you know, controllable uh events
that you can text. Uh in this case
actually uh you can add actions, events,
weather changes, etc. etc. But it also
has like an agentic brain and cerebellum
system that uh continuously proposes new
events as you interact. So, that's
pretty impressive. Now, they do have
kind of a sandbox uh that you can play
around with so you can try it out
without running it locally. Um you know,
uh
you get a sort of a time amount. There's
a couple of like presets here. You can
actually prompt your own world as well.
Uh but let's try let's try siege of the
keep, why not? Um so, we're going to
enter the world here.
Um
So, loading is pretty quick. There's
some tricks to this. Uh this is like the
standard WASD thing. Um you know, of
most of these types of things. And uh
look, as much as I want to grab my mouse
uh is actually just the left and right
arrows. Uh and then we have a couple of
like triggers that we can fire as well.
Uh like a uh one is the flaming volley.
Uh let's see what that does. Oh, there
it goes, flaming volleys. Uh and then
two is a rally cry. So, um I'm not sure
in the other um
uh versions or in the, you know, local
version if you can actually, you know,
prompt for events as well as you can.
So, this is the trick with it um
actually. So, as you can see it kind of
like begins to really kind of like
distort and morph out as you move out
into I'm trying to get to this castle.
Um I don't I don't think that this
generates continuously um as, you know,
something like um like genie will do.
So, uh if we can get there in time, I
think what you'll see when I was playing
around with this earlier, what you'll
see is when we get to the castle keep up
here that what ends up I just want to
throw some more fireballs out there cuz
it's fun.
Um ooh this guy is kill him.
Um okay, I'm right out of time. I got to
hurry up. Yeah, see there you go. That's
where the switch ends up happening,
right? So um once you get to a certain
point in the world, what it just does is
it kind of respawns you back to another
location. In a weird sort of way, it's
actually pretty smart um
in that oh what are we getting over
here? Oh, that's kind of cool. It's like
um
it's kind of freaking out. Oh, okay, we
lost it there.
Um yeah, that was kind of neat. We were
kind of losing the edge of the
singularity or the what does uh
Dennis call or Dennis call it the
footholds of the singularity? I think
that's lit- literally what we just saw.
So again, what I do like about this is
the fact that it is a bit more on the
contained side. Like it feels very open
uh and that you can explore anywhere,
but as we saw, it kind of kicks you back
to another location at some point or
another. I think that's pretty smart. Uh
we've definitely seen that in Genie 3
that when you kind of start to move
outside of the bounds of what it, you
know, it knows or what it what it seeds
in with, the things start to get a bit
blobby and decoherent. And in this case,
it actually kind of manages to hold
together a lot longer. So I think
there's a lot of interesting use cases
that can come out of this aside from
just, you know, sort of like pseudo game
um in that, you know, in the ca- in the
case of like our castle over here that
like if you just were to create this as,
you know, a virtual set of sorts and
then you can kind of like fly your
camera around through this. That might
be pretty interesting. That's just like
one example of something you can do with
uh a world model like this. Once again,
code for Ling World 2.0 is over on
Hugging Face. And uh if you don't feel
like going through the hassle of the
local install, you can try it out. That
link is also down below. Closing out on
real-time AI avatars. Uh Anima AI is
releasing their Character 4 model. This
is one that I've been keeping an eye on
uh and this version looks pretty good.
Here, let's check it out with uh two AI
avatars talking to each other.
>> Because people don't just want to spit
words into the void. We want to see
expressions and attention and emotion.
A face gives you something to respond
to, to connect with.
>> yeah, that's pretty good. Uh you know, I
think this this kind of puts us in a
very interesting place right now with uh
voice being as good as it is. I've been
spending a lot of time playing around
with uh GPT's voice uh voice one uh
model, and that is a it's a very good
voice model. I mean, it does still kind
of mhm you when you're talking to it,
but it can get a little annoying. So,
you know, taking something like this
really just goes to show that what, you
know, we're getting to the point of
voice sounding very good. So, pretty
soon most of our our AI voices are going
to have a face. Real-time flamethrower
girl co-hosting the show along with me.
I mean, yeah, probably going to happen.
I mean, maybe even sometime this year.
But, until then, I thank you for
watching. My name is Tim.
