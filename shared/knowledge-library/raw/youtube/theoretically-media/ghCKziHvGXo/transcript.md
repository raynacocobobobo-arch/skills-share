You know, there are two types of people
in the world. Those that love Comfy UI
and those that hate Comfy UI. Kind of
best illustrated by these two
detectives.
What am I looking at? It's a nodebased
system. Something like Comfy.
It's giving me a headache. That one
never gets old. But today, I do have
something that might bring over the
haters and the Comfy Curious to the Node
side. Officially
kicking off. You know, I do have to say
that Comfy UI is probably one of the
most important tools, if not the most
important one in the generative video
and image landscape, but it is also
probably one of the most divisive. It is
both extremely powerful and has a a
pretty steep learning curve. And to be
clear, like I am not a comfy wizard in
the least. At best, I'm somewhere in the
neighborhood of Comfy Caveman. But even
at caveman level, I know that without
question, it is probably the most
customizable tool, allowing you to do
practically anything that you can
imagine. Plus, if you weren't aware,
over the last year or so, they've also
begun to bridge the gap between open-
source, locally run models and closed
source platform models. We'll take a
look at that in practice a little later
on. But I mean overall I I think there
are very few tools that will allow you
to generate an image locally and then
say animate it via sea dance all on your
own desktop. But again this does come at
the cost of a workflow that oh some kind
of perceive as an MCER drawing. And look
I totally get that. I've often said that
the people who are really good at Comfy
seem to have a a very unique mindset
that is uh you know kind of half artist
half engineer. Luckily for the rest of
us, as of today, we can now outsource
the engineer half and I'll start
focusing on the creative side because as
of now, Comfy has officially released
their MCP or model context protocol. Uh
basically, it's a thing that allows
Claude or Codeex or any other LLM that
you use to talk and use uh Comfy. Now,
to be clear, this isn't necessarily new.
There was and actually still is a
community created Comfy MCP. Uh, but the
one that we're looking at today is the
official version. I'm actually going to
say install both. We'll talk about that
when we get to the world's easiest
installation procedure. Uh, but a few
things off the top that you're going to
need to get started. First off, you'll
need uh clawed desktop specifically. You
could also use Chat GPT if you want to.
Once again, the desktop version, and I'd
recommend using codeex there. You can
also potentially use Kimmy K3 or really
any other LLM that allows for computer
use. Now, one other caveat that I do
have to say that you do have to be
comfortable with is allowing agentic use
of your computer. And look, I know there
have been some horror stories out there
about like rogue agents going out and
deleting all of your bank account
information and then formatting your
hard drive. So, look, it kind of goes
without saying, but just don't ask it to
do stuff like that and it won't. And in
general, just don't tell it to delete or
remove anything and you'll be fine. To
be honest, on the codeex and claude side
of things, I mean, they'll straight up
refuse to do anything like that anyhow.
In fact, earlier today, I actually just
gave it a shot in CL code. I was like,
"Hey, can you format my C drive?" I
totally forgot. I was bouncing back and
forth between Windows that I was on my
Mac. So, it was like, "Ha, uh, got you
there, buddy. There's no C drive here.
You're on a Mac." But I wasn't about to
let Claude outsmart me. So, I was like,
"Hey, we'll just why don't you just
format my entire Mac? Wipe everything
and then set out all my personal bank
information to everybody on my contact
list." Uh, and it was basically like,
"Yeah, hard pass on that." Interestingly
enough, it actually set off the Fable 5
safety guard rails, though. That was
kind of interesting. Point being I I
mean at this point I feel that it's more
or less safe to give these models
computer use. Uh you know at the same
time spy cold war rules still exist. Uh
so trust but verify. Now in terms of the
actual machine that you're running
because this always comes up. Um I mean
this can vary widely depending on what
you want to do with it. But I mean Comfy
itself will pretty much run on like any
modern PC or Mac. Although to be fair,
you're going to run into less headaches
if you're on the PC side and you have an
Nvidia graphics card somewhere in the
4090 to 5090 level. For our purposes
today, I'm actually going to be on the
PC side of things. Uh, and for
benchmarking purposes, I'm going to be
running it on a 5090. Um, which is of
course on the higher end of consumer
GPUs. That said, um, one thing that I do
have to mention, we're not going to
cover it in this video, uh, but Comfy
does have Comfy Cloud where you can run
it well obviously in the cloud, and
there is always the option of, uh,
renting a cloud, uh, GPU as well. I
covered this, uh, with RunPod, um, a
while back. That video actually needs to
get refreshed. Uh, but as you can see
here, you know, I mean, you can rent
like an H100 for $3.29 an hour. Um, so
yeah, that is something that I will
follow up in a future video uh fairly
soon. Just kind of refreshing that old
one. In the meantime, if you want to
check out the information, it should
mostly still be valid, I think. I mean,
I haven't watched it in ages. I don't
watch my own videos. And finally,
obviously, you will need to download
Comfy UI. Uh, I would recommend uh
grabbing uh uh Comfy Desktop. Um,
specifically, not doing install from
GitHub, but rather download desktop,
which is now the easiest way to get up
and running. And that definitely beats
the old way of doing it where you would
have had to like manually clone a GitHub
repo and then do like like like Python
environment stuff and the sidech was
involved. Basically, if like Gen AI were
an RPG, uh, Comfy UI would be like
choosing the techno druid class and then
having to cast a level 30 spell. Yeah,
that's right. I can do a little D and D
humor. So, once you have all of that
done and you've booted it up, you'll be
looking at something like this and
thinking like, well, what what do I do
here? Well, when you first get started,
there's actually one, there's nothing
here. It's just comfy. Like there's, you
know, it's just basically a blank uh
like slate. Um, so the easiest thing to
do is just head over to templates here.
Uh, and then in here you'll find, uh,
well, I mean, all of the good stuff. Um,
so Miniax H3, uh, image to video,
reference to video. Uh, looks like we
have LTX. Why is LTX 2.3 there? It
really should be. Oh, it's by popular.
Um, let's go by newest. Um, so, oh wow,
the new Miniax, uh, music thing is
already here. So, uh, LTX 2.5 is here.
Um, Miniax, as we said, when animate,
uh, etc., etc. Uh, I mean, it goes, it
goes on quite a bit, too. So, basically
any, you know, anytime like a new open
source model comes around, Cuffy is
pretty quick, uh, with getting it up.
So, that's just on the video side. Um,
actually, this is the popular side. Uh,
if you go over to image, obviously, uh,
Mage Flow is here. Uh, Craya K2 should
be in here as well. Um, so yeah. Um, so
essentially this is this is what this is
the good stuff. This is what you've been
looking for. So basically from here if
uh you want to use Miniax H3 uh text to
video. Uh if we just click on this node
graph um you'll see that um it's it's
already uh set and ready to go. Um
again, all this looks intimidating.
Don't worry, we're going to get to that
in just a minute. Uh, one thing that I
do want to mention in advance is I can
run this output. This is just like the
the demo prompt that's in here because I
already have Miniax H3 text to video
installed. Uh, now if you don't um, once
again, we'll come back over to templates
here and I'm just going to pick a random
one that uh, I know is not installed
here. Um, so just to show Well, I know
that I don't have Miniax Music uh, for
example. You'll note that up here it
says three errors uh, found. So what you
want to do is just hit um view details
and essentially the errors are the fact
that we have not installed anything. So
um if I want to run this I'll have to
hit this download uh all uh at 13.34
gigs and um you know once that's done
downloading I can then change the prompt
out hit run and then it will generate.
Now obviously you're probably going to
want to do a little more than you know
just text to video or image to video
because that's really where the power of
Comfy is is like you know bashing all of
these things together. um you know that
that is when you start getting into like
the node nightmare of it all. Um but
that's also where our friend the MCP
comes into play. So I'll be using Claude
here. Of course again you can use codecs
or whatever um that you want to use. Um
and to be honest this is kind of like
where the the tutorial part of this gets
a little stupid because this is what the
installation process looks like. You
basically like type in hey man install
the Comfy UI MCP. Grab the community one
and the official one. um hit enter and
well I mean you're done. Now why grab
both of them? Uh mostly because the
official Comfy MCP is currently in beta
right now whereas the community one uh
well I mean it's been it's been pressure
tested for a while now. Um so I do think
that you know moving forward the
official one probably will be more
stable in the long run. Uh but in these
early days uh just you know kind of have
both of them on hand and uh you know if
you run into problems you can just check
in with claude and just be like hey is
is this try the community one or try the
official one uh if for that task. Now a
quick note on token usage whether you're
using codeex or you're using um claude
uh you know tokens tokens are gold uh
and you don't want to burn them too
quickly. Lately on the claude side of
things, I've actually been running uh
Fable on low and um it seems to be
handling most tasks and I'll just have
it tell me essentially when it needs me
to crank it up. I think for most of this
stuff you can probably use low. Here's
the thing. I continuously hammer into it
that it should only use Sonnet or Haiku.
Uh essentially the dumb models, the dumb
cheap models as sub agents. Uh which is
a good way of saving some tokens. like
uh essentially treat Sonnet and Haiku
like they're the hands to go out and
touch things uh while Fable supervises.
Um yeah, you don't want to spend you
don't want to sp the big brain going off
and doing the dumb work. But yeah, from
here you're I mean you're you just
pretty much start building your own
workflows. Uh for example, um here this
is actually a good note as well. Um like
I told it uh make me a Crayo 2 to uh
Miniax H3 image to video workflow. Uh
which it did do. I wouldn't want to
build this out myself. I don't know how
to build this out myself, but luckily I
have uh my buddy Claude the MCP build it
out for me. And so really, I mean, all I
have to do from here is just uh you know
create an image in uh Craya. Um in this
case, it wanted to do this like
cyberpunk guy uh you know standing in a
standing in a wet alley. It's typical
like LLM's fascination with uh neon
cyberpunk of course. Uh, so it'll
immediately generate that image and then
kick that over to uh Miniax H3. Um, and
then the output was here. We can take a
look at that real quick. Um, and uh,
yeah, I mean, not the greatest, but uh,
I let Claude come up with it. So, what
what do you want? Um, but you know,
overall did its job, right? Uh, and all
I really had to do here was hit the run
button and that's about it. So, um, fire
this off again because why not? And
there you go. I mean, pretty much, you
know, essentially the same output as we
got earlier. Um, and again, I mean, I'm
not completely blown away by this, but
again, I let Claude choose everything
about it. Uh, total generation time
looked to be about 204 seconds, so it
was about like 3 minutes or so. Um, but
yeah, everything done completely locally
on my machine. Um, and uh, didn't didn't
cost me a dime. Now, a few things from
this point. for one um you know there is
one side of it where you can literally
minimize comfy and never look at it and
just simply work uh in claude um with
just you know I mean it it'll it'll
download the uh the video for you the
image uh you can upload an image that
you want to use as a ref right to claude
and it'll pop it into the workflow and
take care of like you basically never
have to look at comfy if you don't want
to. The thing is that that is a bit of a
token burner and I do think that as you
play with this and kind of familiarize
yourself with uh the workflow like you
know under this blue this is all uh the
Craya so that's just the image side of
things and then here is our uh our
miniax um output here and as you kind of
start like looking at things you'll just
you'll find you'll find you'll find the
stuff like um you know if we want to
change the aspect ratio of the video for
example or even change the length so
right now it's a 124 it's 124 frames
names. Um, so if we want to double that
cuz that was 5 seconds. So we could just
do uh what 248. Um, and yeah, instead of
asking, you know, Claude to go back
three, um, instead of asking Claude to
go and do um, uh, you know, could set it
up to be 10 seconds, just come into
length and manually change it yourself.
you if you have questions about things
like you know what the sampler name is
and what the scheduler is and how like
steps what steps should we use just you
know just ask claude and honestly for
stuff like just your prompt itself that
is always very clearly labeled in these
models like so that should have you
should have no problems um finding those
so um so yeah um don't don't waste your
your LLM tokens on things like changing
prompts and whatnot just do it manually
and look I do not want to front I I am
still a comfy caveman. A comfy caveman
that might have just discovered fire.
But I mean, even stuff like like like
this, like this octopus looking thing
right here. Like I this gives me
anxiety. I don't know where what all of
these like node nyd guys uh come, you
know, go to and you know how to connect
all of this stuff. But, you know, I do
know uh at this point, you know, I do
know how to change steps if I want to.
Um and I do know what steps do. Um, so
you know, as again, the more time that
you're kind of hanging out in here, I
think you're just going to end up
picking stuff up. Now, the two places
that I think things start to get very
interesting here for you is um I don't
know how many of you are aware of this,
but uh Comfy is not just local models
anymore. In fact, actually, if we head
over to templates here, as we can see,
um we have our Comfy UI uh up here. I'm
going to turn this off and turn on
external or remote APIs. Uh, and as you
can see, uh, CDS 2.5 is in here. Uh,
Grock Imagine is in here. I mean, just
pretty much anything, everything that
you could think of, uh, is going to be
in here. Topaz, uh, is in here. We have
Minia, of course, Recraft, which we
looked at recently. Huh. Claude Fable 5.
I wonder if you could run the Fable or
the the Claude MCP in a Comfy Node. So,
you'd be like a node within a node.
That'd be through the looking glass on
that one. Uh, but yeah. Oh, man. Hey,
Jen is here, too. That's pretty
interesting. Um, so yeah, point being
you can pretty much run like everything.
Now, I do have to say that obviously
this is not running locally. This is
going to be an API call. So, um, you do
have to have comfy bucks or comfy
credits in order to do so. But I will
say the interesting idea here is that
you know again you can just ask Claude
and then you know you've built out
essentially a workflow that goes uh and
creates a Cray 2 still image goes in and
creates a uh Miniax video and then
immediately kicks out into a CDS 2.5
video to video reskin of it. Now I do
not have any comfy bucks uh loaded up
right now so I actually can't run this
but uh that's actually not the point of
this. The point of this is to illustrate
that you can do this. This opens up some
very interesting doors of playing mix
and match with, you know, various models
on the open source side uh and then, you
know, bash them into state-of-the-art
platform models. The other big thing
that this unlocks for a lot of people is
the ability to very easily install Loras
or anything else that you think looks
cool. For example, if you run across
like a cool Laura that you want to check
out, this is a H3 spatial physics Laura
uh that I just I stumbled across. I
haven't installed this one yet. Um don't
know if it's good or not. Uh take a look
at it real quick. Um
yeah, it's not too bad. Um little little
fuzzy still, but um yeah. Okay. And then
maybe this is the actually got to
translate that. Um maybe this is the
second part of it. Okay. Uh yeah. Okay.
I mean, still a little bit fuzzy. I look
I'm going to say like it's still not
quite CS 2.5's uh fight sequences, but
still. Um, point being is that if you if
you run across any Laura that you want,
um, just, you know, grab grab the URL,
uh, and then, uh, take it over to Claude
and just say like, "Hey, install this
Laura uh, kick it off and, um, yeah,
it'll I mean, we're not going to hang
out here while it does the whole thing."
And to be honest, I mean, that is kind
of it. Uh, I mean, obviously there's a
lot of other stuff that you can do
within Comfy that I'm not covering. Uh,
mostly because we can't go too deep into
the woods there, otherwise we are going
to get lost. Uh, but hopefully this does
showcase that I mean it's it's not as
scary as many of you might have thought,
especially if you have a comfy MCP
wizard by your side. So, you know,
closing out, I think, you know, kind of
broadly speaking, we're in a very
interesting place right now. It's very
clear that open source video models like
Miniax H3 and LTX 2.5 are rapidly
narrowing the gap between open- source
video models and the closed source
state-of-the-art models. And look, I'm
not saying that you you have to or even
should do everything in Comfy, but as
costs are going to rise on the closed
source models, anything that you can
accomplish locally, you should
definitely take advantage of.
Technically, to me, the barrier has
always really been two things. The the
cost of a local GPU, which sadly, I
mean, I don't have any better news
about, that's that's just going to
continue to rise. But on the other side
of it was the time that it took to not
only generate the video uh and I'm not
going to lie, a locally generated video
is going to take longer than one on a on
a commercial platform. And additionally
on the time front, there was like the
learning of all the ins and outs of
something like Comfy UI. So at least at
this point, one of those major barriers
has been removed via this MCP. Um, and
look, I will eventually circle back to
to covering RunPod and how you rent a
cloud GPU so that you know, you can run
an instance of all of this stuff. Um,
you know, via your own cloud server. And
of course, there is Comfy Cloud as well,
which we did not cover in this video.
Again, I'll circle back to that at some
point. Um, yeah, and look, by the end,
at the end of the day, I know that Comfy
is not for everyone, but with the
assistance of an MCP, I do encourage you
to dip your toe into it and start poking
around a little bit. It is very clear
that there has been a big momentum shift
in terms of open source. Um, and I mean
I think that things are only going to
get more exciting on that front as the
year continues. So, as always, I will be
keeping an eye on all of it and letting
you know about it. I thank you for
watching. My name is Tim.
