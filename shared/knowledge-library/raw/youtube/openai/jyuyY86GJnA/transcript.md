Hi everyone, welcome back to OpenAI
Build Hours. I'm Christine on the
startup marketing team and today I'm
here with Charlie.
>> Hi, I'm Charlie from the developer
experience team.
>> So today our topic is going to be about
value maxing with GPT-3.5.
So next slide. If this is your first
time with us, uh the whole purpose of
Build Hours is to empower you with the
best practices, tools, and AI expertise
to scale your company using OpenAI APIs
and models. Uh down below is our
homepage. So we're constantly posting
new sessions as they come up. Feel free
to check back and you can also catch up
on demand. We also post all of these
sessions on YouTube um on the day of. So
check back later in case you want to
review anything that we're chatting
about today.
So we've traditionally started every
Build Hour with a meme and we're back.
Uh so if we have any Office fans around,
um this is really about just getting
more value per token um and Charlie's
going to walk you through uh some tips
and tricks on how to do this.
So this is our first Build Hour after
GPT-3.5 release. Um so right after we
released this model, we asked everyone
on X kind of why they love this model um
and we were really just like humbled and
and also like taken away by all the
reasons that people submitted. And I
think a common theme that we saw was
just how token efficient this model is
particularly in just having you guys get
the most bang for per token. Um and
recently actually, I think this is two
days ago on X, uh we reached a new
milestone. Um so we're we're really
happy to see that this is resonating
with people um and that this new model
um
is is letting people do more with with
less tokens.
So to give you a snapshot of what we're
talking about today, the first is we're
going to explain this shift that's gone
from token maxing to value maxing.
Um we're going to show you value maxing
in Code X and then also value maxing
your harness. And then I'm really
excited that we will have Floy, um one
of our favorite startups uh join today
to chat about how they've actually
migrated their AI agent over.
And last but not least is Q&A. Um so on
the right side of your screen, if you
toggle over to the Q&A button, you can
actually submit questions and our team
will be in the room um answering them on
chat and then also selecting a few to
answer live towards the end. And we'll
have our friends from Floy also join. So
feel free to ask any questions um
and we're really excited to kick this
off. So over to you, Charlie.
>> Thanks so much, Christine. Um thanks
everybody for joining. So excited to be
here. Uh
I want to talk about value maxing, but
I'm sure there's you know a lot of
questions about what what is that,
right? And I think you can't quite
explain what it is without first
starting with token maxing. Um and I
think token maxing is a term that that
emerged, you know, earlier in this year.
Um and to kind of encapsulate it, right?
It was essentially this this idea of
measuring progress by how much AI you're
using. I think that might be how many
tokens you're burning, how many prompts
you're sending, how many agents you're
managing at the same time. And I think
we even saw companies that had stood up
internal leaderboards to just track, you
know, how many tokens their employees
were using day over day or week over
week.
Later on in the year though, I think
some of that sentiment started to
change, right? Uh we started to see uh
you know, companies that were
accidentally burning through their
entire annual budget for AI in a handful
of months, right? And we started to see
a lot of enterprises start to pull back
and say, "Well, maybe we should be
throttling our AI spend." Um or even
some AI CEOs saying that, you know, some
companies may have gotten carried away
with their with their token
leaderboards. Um and importantly that we
should be measuring employees on the
outputs instead, right? and the value
that they're generating.
So that brings us to value maxing. In
contrast with token maxing, it's
measuring progress not by how much AI
you're using, but what AI is actually
helping you to accomplish, right? How
much work you're getting done, how much
time are you saving, how much, you know,
quality are you improving in the code
and the artifacts that you're making.
I think a question that I like to come
back to when I think about, you know,
this framing of value
is something like if you doubled your
token spend tomorrow, how would you know
if it was worth it, right? You know,
there is perhaps a
naive assumption of like, yeah, like we
spend more on tokens, it's going to be
better, but, you know, how does that
work back to to concrete outcomes?
And I think there are a few questions
that you can start to ask yourself as
you're thinking through this for your
own processes or your own company.
Things like what are the outcomes that
you are trying to improve?
With those outcomes, what are the
workflows that lead to, you know, good
quality outputs? Where in those
workflows can you add intelligence, can
you add AI, can you add tokens, right?
And maybe accelerate or improve quality.
And, you know, what evidence do you have
that you are improving the quality or
that you are, you know, using, building
a working system here, right? A lot of
this, I think when it when folks work
with AI, you've probably heard the term
evals, and I think a lot of AI research
and engineering these days is driven by
having good evals, which to boil it
down, to oversimplify it, basically
means
how do you define what good looks like?
And I think as we move from just having
to AI, you know, having AI chatbots
perform simple tasks to having AI agents
be responsible for entire outcomes, that
question is still very valuable. What
does good look like and how do you
define that and track that within your
company or your role?
And I think I think I I I do want to say
too that, you know, in some cases it
might seem like the answer here is,
well, we should spend fewer tokens,
right? Like we should um our models or
cut spend, and I'm sure in some cases
that's that's absolutely true. Um I did
also want to point out there might be
some cases where you want to spend more
tokens and that's actually still driving
more value, right? Um you may decide,
"Hey, we we actually want to ensure that
we have a high-quality result, so we're
going to bump the reasoning level on the
model um or switch to a bigger model."
You might say, um "It's important that
this gets done faster, so we are going
to spend more on tokens now in order to
save uh you know, real-world all clock
time." Um that might be the case. You
maybe you've got a big migration and you
want to migrate something into a
different programming language. Um maybe
you could do it, you know, in a couple
of months with fewer tokens or, you
know, maybe you can do it in a couple of
weeks and spend some more. Uh similarly,
if you know your workflows are working
well and you want to scale them, then
you can decide to spend more uh in order
to just scale those outputs if they're
working well. And last but not least,
you know, if you want to manage risk, um
you might have a system where it's
really important that the output is is
high quality and, you know, and
bulletproof. Um and in that case, you
may want to do something like use LLMs
as a judge, um and you may want to use
more or use a diverse range of them,
right? In order to ensure that it's
catching uh all sorts of different edge
cases.
Okay. So, with that in mind, I want to
talk about two ways of thinking about
value maxing here. I think one is as an
individual developer while you're using
Codex. Uh and I think another is uh as
an organization or as a company that's
building on top of OpenAI's APIs.
We're going to start with Codex.
Um
like Christine mentioned, I think this
the story of of value maxing in Codex uh
really starts with the GPT-3.5 family,
right? Um if you're not familiar, we've
got three new models in this family:
Soul, Terra, and Luna. Uh Soul is, you
know, our frontier model, our our um
flagship model for the most complex
coding and professional tasks. Terra is
a really great daily driver um and I
think it is, you know, good for uh for
more balanced work where intelligence
and cost or latency both matter.
And Luna, you know, is we really like
and we've gotten a lot of positive
feedback around it for high-volume
workloads where, you know, the the
intelligence level is not as demanding,
but you really do care about cost and
latency.
And I think we've we've put a lot of
work Open AI has put a lot of work into
making these models, especially 5.6,
token efficient.
If you kind of look at this is Deep
Suey, a benchmark popular coding
benchmark that's out there. And if you
take a look at, you know, the
performance on the benchmark relative to
how many tokens you're spending, you can
see that like the most bang for your
token, as Christine mentioned, is is
coming from the 5.6 family. And it's a
mix of different models at different
reasoning levels. So, I think as as as
we've gotten better models and as we've
as we've gotten them to run for longer,
one of the most important things to
think about is not just how many tokens
does it spit out or even like what is
necessarily the the highest amount of
intelligence that it has. I think we're
finding that you can take a model that
is maybe not as smart at one shotting
something, and if you're willing to
spend more tokens on it, you can get
similar performance. So, I think as you
evaluate some of this type of work, it's
useful to take a look at not just cost
per token, but cost per overall task to
completion, right? And
you can you can start to like fiddle
with these and and see how different
things compare along different axes.
Speaking of comparing along different
axes, I want to jump into a demo to
explore a little bit around these models
and their reasoning levels to kind of
get an an idea of you know, what we're
doing.
So, this is a value maxing lab that I
built with the help of GPT 5.6 and
Codex. We're going to make sure this is
open source after the build hour today,
so everybody's going to have access to
this code and you can run this yourself.
Um,
here just on this first page, uh
I had 5.6 build a three-dimensional
chart comparing, you know, a lot of the
leading models in the artificial
analysis intelligence index. Um,
and you can take a look at how they kind
of compare along these different axes of
intelligence, um, cost, and speed,
right? And how often how long it
actually takes to to generate these
outputs.
Um, but I think the more interesting
thing here is this visual matrix, uh
where um
if you supply an API key, like I've done
here, um
I actually I'm going to render a number
of SVGs along the different models and
the different reasoning modes, so we can
kind of see what what the output looks
like. So, um
let's just say instead of a pelican
riding a bicycle, I want a
panda bear,
uh
riding a jet ski.
And I've selected all of them. Let's go
ahead and run
the matrix.
Um, it's going to work in the
background. I think to start with
though, I do want to show everybody, um,
I previously ran this with the pelican
on a bicycle and you can start to see I
think the difference in sophistication,
um, as the models move up, right? And
even if you take a single model, um, I
think you can see the difference in
sophistication, um, along, you know, if
you just take Luna for example,
this first model is, I think, you know,
to be fair is a little bit crude, right?
Um,
but as you introduce more reasoning, uh
the final result is is actually pretty
good, right? Um, it looks like we're
getting some results in here, um, but
you can see like for example Sol starts
out pretty high fidelity, um, and then
as it goes up, it just gets even more
more powerful, right? Obviously, you
want your own benchmarks, you want your
own evals to to measure, and I think a
great product will have this sort of
thing coming in. Um but uh this is just
a a nice little demo to kind of out of
the box take a look at um what is it
like how does it compare across multiple
different uh reasoning levels, right?
And so we can see um
we can see the run that I just started,
right? It's coming in and you know
already uh
you know even just on a few examples
here, you can see there's like not much
shading going on in this first one uh
versus now we've added like green for
the islands, uh bigger like more
detailed waves, uh shading on the sun
and the clouds in the background, um
which I think is pretty cool just to be
able to visually see everything that's
going on here.
>> Cool.
>> Um
I think some more practical tips and
tricks when it comes to uh using Codex
and trying to get the most value out of
it. Uh
you know, we saw a little bit of the the
grid there in terms of how the reasoning
levels differ, but my rule of thumb here
is to start with Soul uh and
specifically start with Soul on medium.
Um I think it's a really great model,
and I do want to kind of dispel the
notion here. I see a lot of developers
who just assume I have to be on extra
high for everything out of the box,
right? Um and I think that is definitely
true for for sophisticated workloads,
for complex projects that you're
tackling, but a lot of day-to-day stuff
is actually going to be really well
served by 5.6 Soul on medium. Um I think
if you're finding it's not quite as
intelligent as you need, or it's not
quite as thorough as you were hoping
for, um you can tune up. Uh and in some
cases, you might even decide to to tune
down and to swap to uh the light
reasoning or even to to 5.6 Tera um if
the work you're doing is not very
coding, you know, intensive.
Um I think the second tip here is to
consider when you might want to trade
tokens for time. I think there's like uh
a number of ways where uh you you might
just want something to go faster and you
might want to save your own time in in
exchange for more tokens. Fast mode is
the obvious um use case here. You can
turn on
fast mode
uh to run your outputs at 1.5 x speed.
Though, it will consume your usage
limits a bit faster. Um, you we highly
recommend auto approval as the default
mode um for a number of reasons. I think
um you know, we we don't recommend using
full access in Codex at this point. Um,
and I would you know, I know personally
and from hearing from a lot of
developers uh requesting permissions on
every single action is a little bit
frustrating. So, um auto approval I
think is a great sweet spot uh to have
another model review the uh the outputs
and make sure that they're safe.
Um, and Chronicle is a a relatively new
feature in Codex. Um, and if you turn
that on, that will allow you to I think
record your screen and it basically
develops memory for the task that you're
doing. So, as you start to do similar
tasks over and over again, um you can
you know, use you'll use more tokens to
to remember what's happening, but it'll
get smarter about the type of work that
you do every day.
Uh the third thing here is um take a
look at your agent's MD and your skills.
I think models have gotten um you know,
very much more sophisticated, much more
intelligent, and I think a lot of the
things that we had in our agent's MD and
our skill instructions 6 or 12 months
ago um might be unnecessary now. I think
when it comes to instruction following
and persistence, um you know, we can go
back and audit and say, "Hey, do we
really need to be explicit about every
single thing in here?" Or is there a way
to make this concise and save on our
input tokens?
So, now I want to switch to talking
about value maxing your harness, right?
Or you know, your your product if you're
building on top of uh our APIs.
Um there are a handful of I think key
API features here that um
we we've recently introduced or or
somewhat recently introduced to try to
help uh developers get more value. Um
and I'm going to talk through a few of
them here. I think programmatic tool
calling is a big one. Uh we recently
introduced this with the launch of 5.6.
And this is a really cool new feature
where um to oversimplify a little bit,
we give the model access to a sandbox, a
JavaScript sandbox, and it can write
code to execute in that sandbox. Um that
code can do things like call tools or
run computations. Um and you're moving
all of that, you know, all of that work
out of the model's chain of thought, out
of its reasoning, um and into the
sandbox. And so, you're both saving
tokens because it's not, you know,
itself reasoning through the math or the
logic of something, and you're saving
time potentially because it can make a
bunch of tool calls um without having to
round trip all the way through the model
and then all the way back uh to the end
user.
Um we also have had prompt caching. I
think that's changed a little bit
recently with the introduction of 5.6.
Um but now uh we Yeah, we we have the
ability for you to specify, you know,
which parts of your prompts you want to
cache. Um
this can be a really great way to to
save both time and tokens as well. Um I
think you can do some things um You can
be also a little bit smart about how
you're using your prompts. I think one
example here is
let's say you have a product where it's
important to know what date it is, for
example, right? Um you would want to
actually append that information to the
end of your prompt. Um and if you may
maybe you've got like a massive a 10,000
token prompt, and then you want to
append at the end, oh, and by the way,
today's date is, you know, July 23rd,
right? Um and by doing so, like if you
did it at the beginning, uh it would
make your life a lot harder when it
comes to trying to cache that prompt. Um
and if you do it at the end, you can
take all of that, you know, chunks of
your prompt that don't change and save a
lot of money by caching them. Uh
persistent reasoning is another new
feature. Um basically, we've exposed the
ability in the API to uh previously, it
would we would have like reasoning
summaries or you would just chain the
the final assistant messages together.
But now with persistent reasoning, you
can save the reasoning turns across and
we do find this um this improves uh
continuity of answers. So, it is a boost
to performance and capability, but also
cache efficiency, right? If you do want
to just say, "Okay, we're we're just
going to keep sending all of these
through and and we can get better on our
caching." Um and last but not least,
compaction. Uh this one has been around
for a little while, but definitely want
to call this one out because um if you
are finding that your use case has a lot
of user prompts that get very long, uh
very heavy, lots of tool calls, lots of
things that were exploratory, but maybe
not useful in the long run, um you can
uh turn on auto compaction um or you can
decide if you want to explicitly trigger
compaction yourself through the API, uh
and then, you know, just reduce the
amount of inputs that you're sending
every time.
Cool. So, if we go back to uh the demo,
uh we can see I think a bunch of these
pandas finished up, right? Um again, I
think some of them to varying degrees of
realism and and accuracy here. Um but I
want to go to this third tab here um in
our uh
optimization lab, right? And I want to
share maybe I need to refresh this real
quick.
Um
I think I want to share uh some of these
outputs um because we're going to do a
little bit of AB testing across some of
the features that I just talked about,
right? Um this first one is prompt
caching. And so, in this demo, uh behind
the scenes, I'm making an API request um
with a I think it's like a 5 and 1/2
thousand token prompt. Um, and we're
going to go ahead and cache it and then
we're going to do two API requests to
see um, how how the results ended up
coming out with and without caching,
right?
And so we can see here that um,
the input costs were 90% lower um, when
it comes to to using the cache, right?
Um, and uh,
if you have things it looks like the the
wait time slowed down by a couple of
seconds. Um, but if you're if you don't
need, you know, like the absolute most
latency and you know you're going to
reuse a bunch of prompts, um, if you've
got like a massive, you know, system
prompt that you want to cache, uh, this
is uh, a really great way to uh, to save
on cost.
Um, the second here is going to be uh,
programmatic tool calling.
And so uh, behind the scenes I've I've
crafted a prompt um, that's basically
asking for a specific task. Uh, it needs
to call a number of tools, it needs to
list accounts, track their usage, um,
and then, you know, create a support
ticket. Um, and normally with uh,
without programmatic tool calling, um,
we would have the model, it would call
tools, those results would be returned
to the model, it would decide what to do
next, maybe call more tools, and then
generate the final answer. Um, with
programmatic tool calling though, the
model, like I said, has this JavaScript
sandbox. It's writing code to just
inject into that sandbox, and the
sandbox is going to call the tools, it's
going to crunch the numbers, uh, and
then return the final results, and then
the model is going to decide to answer,
right?
And so we can see here um, that yeah, we
ended up with 24% fewer tokens, uh,
input tokens by using programmatic tool
calling. Um, we saved I think an entire
model turn, uh, by using the sandbox.
Um, and not only I think is the, you
know, this is a little bit of a toy
example, right? Um, so I think, you
know, if you want to test this yourself,
definitely use a real world use case.
Um, but not only did we save on input
tokens, um, we actually save on output
tokens cuz the model had to do less
reasoning about the final answer um, and
then figure out how it's going to like
return that to the user. Um, and in this
demo too, we can just check um, you
know, if you if you behind the scenes
change the prompt, you can check like
did it actually get to the same uh,
output, right? Which in this case it did
and that's what we want to see.
Um, in this one uh, this is a also a
quick context compaction one, right? So,
um, basically, you know, there's a uh,
pretty big history. I think there was
like 72 prior turns or hand-offs in this
uh, in this use case. Um, and I want to
see how it compares when we um,
ask a a question and ask for the answer
versus if we trigger a compaction first
uh, and then ask for the answer, right?
And what I'm expecting to see um, is
hopefully the same answer, but also um,
I think significantly fewer uh, input
tokens when when it comes to uh,
comes to our costs, right? Yeah, and so
I think this is you know, uh, quite a
dramatic output. We've got 82% fewer
input tokens for the same task. Um,
without compaction, we were sending
24,000 input tokens and then after it
was, you know, a little over 4,000. Um,
in this case it's just asking for a
single answer, so there was not a ton of
of output or reasoning. Um, but I think
again a useful experiment for your own
use cases. If you think you will need a
lot of reasoning tokens, can we tune
this this prompt or this scenario to
figure out how it's going to go, right?
Um,
I think in this case it was a little bit
faster um, but uh, you did ultimately
take a hit on the compaction time. It
looks like it took uh, a little under 30
seconds to to compact. Um, and then
yeah, we expect to see the exact same
answer coming out uh, which is what we
see here.
>> [clears throat]
>> Cool. Um, and so I've talked a lot about
you know, uh, theoreticals and in in how
OpenAI sees stuff, but I also want to
make sure we're we're talking about some
real-world use cases. And for that,
we're going to turn it over to Ploy.
>> Awesome. Thanks so much.
Um
Let's please welcome Ploy on stage.
We'll just give them a minute.
Ryan, Lorenzo.
>> Yeah. Can you guys hear me?
>> Yes, you're good.
Hey Ryan. Hey Lorenzo.
Okay. Thanks for joining us today. Um
we saw on the front page of Hacker News,
you guys put out a great guide on
migrating a production agent over um to
5.6 Soul. Um so really excited for you
guys to be here with us live chat
through. Um first, a little bit about
what what you guys are building over at
Ploy. Um and then also just kind of a
step-by-step guide um through through
this um
through how you guys migrate your agent.
So feel free to take it away.
>> Amazing. Um hi everyone. Uh I'm just
trying to share my screen. It's
disabled.
>> We'll stop sharing screen on our side.
>> Okay, great.
Amazing. Um all right. Welcome everyone.
Um
my name is Bryant and I'm excited to
uh share a little bit about what we're
building here at Ploy. And uh today
uh I have my AI engineer extraordinaire
Lorenzo joining me.
Um so I was previously the co-founder
and CTO of Webflow. So I spent about 12
and 1/2 years there. And
about
eight or nine months ago,
you know, AI happened,
agents happened, and I'm like, well,
what can the website actually do to help
a business grow? You know, I made a tool
that made it easy for folks to design,
but I just had this incredible itch to
take the website much further.
So, that's what we're building at Play.
So, what Play is, it's an entire
marketing platform that's starting with
your website. It gives you the ability
to run SEO, AEO optimization,
helps you improve your conversions. It's
also a web host. But, then on top of
that, it can also power your ads, it can
help you find customers, it can
de-anonymize the visitors coming to your
website, all with the purpose to help
turn your website into your hardest
working employee. And by that, I mean
help you drive revenue as automatically
as possible.
So, how does it work? So, very simple,
you sign up and within 60 seconds, you
have a Slurp'd website. So, what that
means is is that we're crawling your
sites, we're taking all of the CSS,
we're looking at every single responsive
breakpoint, and we're actually
deterministically
converting your existing homepage into a
design system that Play can then use to
build subsequent pages or optimize your
existing ones.
And if you actually want to design from
scratch, uh you can also use Play to do
that, too. So,
really sort of proud of the fact that
Play's platform doesn't have any AI
tells or as few of them as possible.
Every single site is actually incredibly
bespoke.
So, there's a lot of different things
that Play can do for you. So, it can
design with human taste, it can drive
revenue outcomes, it can help you
measure your entire sort of marketing
funnel with built-in analytics. And
then, we also have these expert
Playbooks that you can run, and you can
think of them as marketing skills.
Just to drive home this sort of point a
little bit. So, this is something that
people can actually do with Play, which
is they can actually create this whole
sort of marketing funnel that's
autonomous. So, someone comes to your
site, we can deanonymize that person, we
can help qualify that person to see if
they're your ICP, and we can activate
that lead. We can sync it to your CRM,
we can draft the email and send it out.
These are just some of the ways that we
can really turn your website into a
growth engine.
And you can do a bunch of things, too.
So, we actually have these playbooks
that, you know, really well-known growth
and marketing leaders throughout the
tech startup scene have created for
Play. So, to help you create AEO
comparison pages, to help you build a
content strategy,
or even email your ICP website visitors.
And just to wrap it up,
it's really for a lot of different
audiences. So, large startups, large
enterprises, [clears throat] agencies,
and
a place where I have a lot of affinity
for, which is YC startups. And I was
part of the last YC batch, and really
proud to say that around 13% of the
startups in the last batch are also
using Play.
So, I'll just hand it over to let
Lorenzo to actually talk about the true
value maxing part
that we spent a lot of time on here at
Play.
>> For sure.
Um
let me get my presentation up.
All right. What up, fam?
My name's Lorenzo, and I'm an AI
engineer. I
just I actually started AI engineering
when I joined Play, and I've just been
obsessed and having so much fun. Um I
really love optimizing things and saving
costs. So, this is actually something
we've been working on for a long time
with our agent even
before we switched to GPT 5.6.
Um but all the work that we've done
prior carries over to GPT 5.6 and I
figured that was probably the most
valuable thing to talk about in this
presentation.
So, this
dovetails really nicely off of
um Charlie's talk about, you know,
compaction, efficient tool calling, uh
programmatic tool calling,
um caching.
I I of those four,
I would say caching is kind of the the
most
important and sort of easily overlooked.
And there's a lot of details, so I
figured it's worth diving in.
So, just a quick explainer on
how exactly
KV caching or prompt caching works
um in your typical agent loop.
When you Every time the agent
try decides what to do next, it has to
process all of the prior input tokens.
So, if you have an agent loop that
calls, you know, 10 tools across 10
different steps, there's actually a n
squared amount of like tokens that get
processed because um the context
accumulates and every time you call the
next tool call,
you have to process all the previous
tokens
and that's just, you know, building up
is kind of what you're seeing here.
So, with caching enabled, what that
allows is uh basically a 10x reduction
in cost for all of the tokens that have
already been processed uh cuz OpenAI and
other AI providers store the embeddings
from all those tokens.
And so, you know, this is just massive
for
cost efficiency
and um it also helps with um
responsiveness in
generally with
with really long contexts.
Um but even if you have
uh caching enabled
it's really easy for this
cache to break because this context
window needs to be append only in order
for the
um for the caching to accumulate and
persist. So this example here, if you're
trying to be smart about saving tokens
and say like dynamically loading tools,
the tools actually live at the very
beginning of the uh context window. So
if you are modifying the tools as you
are going through different steps uh in
the agent loop, that breaks your cache
and you're going to end up with a ton of
next cost um like we talked about on the
previous slide.
Um as Charlie mentioned too, like if
you're updating any information in the
system prompt like uh the current time,
that will break the system
uh the KB cache as well
um which really hurts your uh
cost. So um
there's a few
tricks that we've implemented
um in order to
first load tools on demand without
breaking the cache. So all we've really
done here is
we decided what tools need to be always
on.
And those are like the core tools that
we see
um but based on usage patterns they are
used in like you know 70% or more of
sessions. And then we have a lot of
tools that are more niche and we call
these on-demand tools.
And so when the agent needs to use one
of these on-demand tools, it simply
loads this tool schema. It gets appended
to the end of the uh context window. So,
you don't break any of the cash up here.
And then the agent is is able to use the
these on-demand tools perfectly fine
using the on-demand tools tool.
And um yeah, in our testing we saw a 45%
We're able to reduce the the tokens of
our tool schemas by 45%.
Um and in evals that showed like a 33%
cost reduction, which was really
awesome.
Um
and and and quick side note is like if
we had broken the cash every time we're
like
updating the tool schema, this would
actually end up being more expensive.
So, it's a it's a really great uh
strategy, but you need to make sure you
do it right to not break the KV cache.
Um
another thing that is really helpful for
uh maximizing the cache hit rate is
using breakpoints.
And this is something that I went over
in uh my GPT-5.6
implementation guide. Um
this is slightly different between AI
providers. We've we've used both uh
Claude, Gemini, and GPT models. And um
this is this is a part where there's a
little bit of variation between
providers. Um but the the core concept
is the same.
Uh which is you
if if if you have a user that is um
creating multiple chats within your
platform,
you will likely have a set of tools and
a system prompt that is the same for
every chat.
So,
this like we were talking about before,
you don't need to process the system
prompt and the tools every single time.
So, you if you if you set a a breakpoint
to cache the system prompt and the
tools, this now gets saved for every
single chat afterwards. And
so, you can save a lot of tokens this
way. Um and then on top of that, there
there's like
um a feature that we have in the Play
Agent is working memory
or the workspace memory. So, this is
persistent across chats.
And this is unique to each workspace.
And this may change between chats, but
it may not. So, we set another
breakpoint after the workspace memory.
So, if there's multiple chats where the
workspace memory does not change, then
we're able to cache that as well and uh
increase the cache hit rate um
by And yeah, and the results of this was
the first message, if you're able to
cache the system prompt, uh and the tool
calls, which is really large for us, we
saw an 89% reduction in the first
message in a new chat.
And um yeah, this this reduced our token
spend by 5% overall in production.
And um
this is a trick I love because it's so
simple um
and
kind of like right under your nose sort
of thing. So, if you have a an agent
that's making a lot of tool calls, for
example, a coding agent, like uh the
Play Agent,
there's going to be a lot of token uh a
lot of tool calls within a single
uh session.
So,
and and batching these together makes a
huge difference. So, this example is
three tool calls: edit file A, read file
B, read file C. They're all independent.
Um but if the agent is doing these in
three separate steps, it has to re
uh process all of the input tokens and
the whole context window, and it
actually does a little bit of thinking
for each tool call.
Um but this is all this can be saved if
you just prompt the agent to try to
batch together tool calls into a single
step.
Um that looks like this, and you save
all of these um cached input tokens and
the extra thinking tokens here.
Um lastly, you can also design your
tools to perform multiple actions in one
tool call. So, that's what we've done
here, where you say read file B and file
C in one tool call, and that saves um
output tokens. And so, when we we
implemented this, ran some evals, we saw
a 14% cost reduction with the same pass
rate, and and I think it was actually a
little bit faster, too. So, win across
the board.
Um lastly,
I just There's a lot more I didn't cover
here, but as kind of a general
tip or or area of focus for me is really
optimizing your tools. So, Charlie,
again, mentioned programmatic tool
calling.
There's so much you can do just if you
or just design your tools in an
intelligent way.
Um
one really easy win for us, we use Exa
as our web search provider, and they
have a feature called highlights, which
slims down the output to just the most
important sort of like bullet points.
Immediate 70% reduction
in the web
tool response size, and that's estimated
to save us $37,000 a year in tokens. Um
and the same quality on our evals.
Um another thing here, we have
put a lot of thought into
thinking about what needs to be done by
the agent versus what can we just make
deterministic. Um there's one tool where
we um were able to save like a huge
round trip from the tool to the agent to
the next tool call.
Um and yeah, that was like a 54%
reduction in token spend.
So, yeah, that's pretty much it.
Uh lot more I could cover, and then as
Christine mentioned, we have a blog post
here on actually migrating to GPT-5.6.
There were for the most part, like I
said, everything carried over really
easily from the previous agent in terms
of our caching stuff, but there were
some details on the
breakpoints and stuff that we cover in
that blog.
Uh but yeah, that's it for me.
>> Awesome. Thanks so much for joining us.
Um we'll go back and share screen.
Thanks everyone who submitted so many
questions. We answered as many as we
could. We had chat, there's a couple
that we flagged to answer live and chat
go through them, especially with with
Brian Lorenzo here with us to kind of
share this actual real-life example.
Um so, the first one was probably the
most important.
Brian,
>> [snorts]
>> Troy really loved it.
I think it's awesome for you to be here,
especially as a founder. We have a ton
of startup founders who are building
really on early on in their journey.
Would love to hear from you, just like
kind of a quick update on like why you
chose to migrate and some of the
trade-offs, especially as a second-time
founder.
>> Yeah.
I think, you know, as a startup, we're
constantly looking for some type of
alpha, right? Some type of advantage.
But then, honestly, with with building
AI tools, you you really just have to
try every single model that's out there,
right? And
we have spent a lot of time making sure
that our evals reflect real-world use
cases, and that whenever a new model
comes out, many companies do this,
obviously, but we really want to stress
test, you know, whether or not they fit
Poe's use cases. So, you know,
everything from marketing strategy to
following really long instructions to
redesigning a whole page to importing a
WordPress site. You know, these are all
things that are
our agents uh need to be really good at.
So, um as a second-time founder, I don't
know, maybe
there's potentially even a disadvantage
in this in the sense that AI is just so
uh quick that a lot of my learned
experiences may need to be unlearned,
and I have to really drink from the
firehose now. So, that's um that's been
really, really fun.
>> Love that. Thanks for sharing.
Um okay, let's dive into some of the the
technical questions. Um this first one,
when using GPT-5 uh 0.6 with Ultra
Effort, it seems extremely token
intensive when delegating work to sub
agents. Are sub agents given only the
specific context needed for their task,
or do they receive and maintain the full
context of the current chat or
workspace?
>> Um I love that somebody asked this.
Thank you for asking this question, cuz
I think there's currently a lot of
confusion out there around the
differences between Ultra and Max and
Pro. Um
and so, I think to to maybe start, like,
I want to explain the difference between
um Max and Pro, and then we'll get to
Ultra. So, uh Max is a new reasoning
effort level above extra high. Prior to
GPT 5.6, uh the highest you could go was
extra high. Um and then now with 5.6,
there is there is Max, which essentially
just like, you know, fully takes the
leash off and and tells the model like,
"Use as much reasoning as as you think
you might need to solve this problem."
Um that is in contrast to Pro, which
historically is, you know, been
available as an option in ChatGPT and
not Codex. Um
as well as through the API. Uh you may
have noticed if you're a heavy API user,
you may have noticed that there's no GPT
5.6 Pro uh model slug in the API. Um and
that's because we've actually moved it
into a new reasoning mode uh parameter.
And so, you can take uh any of the new
5.6 models in reasoning mode, you know,
there's like standard and Pro. Um and
that'll essentially give you the same uh
the same effect as using Pro in chat. Um
but it'll spend significantly more
tokens, will take significantly longer
to come back to you with an answer.
Um
Okay. So, now that we've talked about
those two, let's talk about Ultra. Um
Ultra is not quite a new reasoning
level, but it's it's a little bit of a a
new mode that exists on top of Max
reasoning. And so, in Codex or in
ChatGPT work, um if you select Ultra
mode, and by the way, to get to Max and
Ultra, um I believe they're not enabled
out of the box uh because, you know, we
we want folks to be mindful about their
token spend. Um and so, if you go into
settings, you can enable those two
options. But, Ultra takes Max reasoning,
um which already is like uses many
reasoning tokens as you need, um and
then also modifies the underlying system
prompt to um
push it in the direction of using more
subagents, right? And 5.6 is the first
model that we've trained that's like
natively um meant to use subagents. I
think in previous models in Codex, you
could tell it, "Hey, use subagents for
this task." and it would do so. But, 5.6
is the first model where
it is making calls for itself and like,
"Okay, here's where I should probably
use a sub agent or not." And and Ultra
basically turns that behavior also to
the max, right?
So, if it seems extremely token
intensive, it 100% is extremely token
intensive. And we do recommend it for
like the, you know, the really heavy
hitter use cases where,
just, you know, you need to spin up sub
agents to to accomplish a ton of work.
Otherwise, you know, if you're using it
to check your email, it's a little bit
like bringing a bazooka to a knife
fight, right? Like, you probably don't
need that much firepower.
Um,
but let's get back to the to the meat of
the question here. You know, are sub
agents given only the specific context
needed or do they receive the full
context?
They're given the context that they
need, right? And so, the the
main agent will dispatch
a sub agent and that can go and and
perform tasks and then return. That's
different to say like a side chat in
Codex, which is going to get the full
context of the current chat as it works.
>> Thanks for sharing that, Lorenzo.
Anything on your end that you wanted to
add to this if you've you've tried it?
>> Um,
this [clears throat] Yeah, my first
thought when I saw this question was you
could actually, if from a developer's
standpoint, you could implement it
either way. I haven't tried this, but I
have thought about um,
this [clears throat] this idea of giving
a sub agent the full context. It would
almost be like forking the context
window.
Um, I haven't tried this. I think most
implementations just have the
orchestrator agent write up a summary of
whatever the sub agent needs. That's
probably more efficient in most cases.
>> Awesome, thanks for sharing. Okay, next
question. How does agent depth, meaning
the number of delegation layers where
sub agents can spin up their own sub
agents, affect performance? What types
of tasks benefit from greater depth, and
when is a wider but shallower agent
structure more effective.
>> Um I think the first question is that's
a really good question. I I don't know
that I that I have all the data to
recommend something on here, right? In
terms of performance. Um I think I what
I can say about the types of tasks is
uh you know I think it's
you know, I think it's it's I personally
in the work that I do, I think I
personally um find it less effective
once you get past maybe two layers of
sub agents because I think you're losing
a lot of context um as you continue to
delegate and again that's that's totally
anecdotal. Um and in general I think I
find that agents like sub agents in
general are more useful when the work
can be like parallelized pretty um
effectively, right? And you're not super
worried about like having to share state
or having to like touch the exact same
files as you go um and you're able to
like, you know,
carve out independent lanes for each sub
agent to work with, but again, Lorenzo,
happy to to hear your take.
>> Yeah, the we we've been experimenting
with sub agents for a while in Poe and
we found with, you know, the models that
were around 3 months ago
we're actually way better off just not
using sub agents at all in terms of
costs, uh performance, and time.
Um I think the the meat of this question
really comes down to which model are you
using and how good are the orchestration
abilities of that model cuz
sub agents, like delegating a task from
one LLM to another LLM,
is is a bit lossy.
Um
you
want these,
you know, tasks or the direction to be
as human-driven as possible or
expert-driven. Um Um, that is changing
with recent models. Um, like G G5.6
Souls orchestration abilities are much
better. Um, if you want to do multiple
layers,
the question is
the the if you're having a an
orchestrator agent delegate to a sub
agent and then that sub agent delegates
to another sub agent, is that second
level sub agent good at orchestrating
sub agent tasks? If you're doing Soul
Soul Soul, maybe, but if you're doing
Soul
Terra Luna, you might be losing uh
some efficiency there, but overall, I'd
just say proceed with caution and
yeah. [laughter]
>> Love that. Great advice.
Um, okay. Next question. Are there
instances where starting a new chat in a
project such repo is better than
compaction?
>> Um, yeah, I don't know if this is a
little bit of a spicy take, but I think
there there probably still are some some
instances. Um, and
by and large, I I don't think about
compaction anymore. I think when I work
in Codex, I'm happy to work in the same
thread for for days if not weeks and and
I, you know, just keep going. I think I
used to be a year ago I used to be one
of those people that was like every
single new thing is like new thread, new
chat, right? To avoid, you know, context
pollution. Um, and now I don't worry
about that as much. I think the
instances where it is so useful is if
your uh personal setup is like very
heavily loaded with like a ton of
context out of the box, um, and you are
enabling like a ton of plugins or skills
or, you know, attaching files, um,
because that is going to be stuff that
you want to, you know, presumably
they're all relevant, but that is stuff
that you're going to want to be bringing
in. Um, and if it's, you know, if it's
stuff that the model has to keep in mind
for every answer, then in that case, uh
it probably makes sense to start a new
chat rather than relying on compaction.
>> Yeah.
All right, so are you team new chat,
same chat? Thoughts?
>> Yeah, we've seen users have super long
chats in work sessions in play and then
just use that for everything. And it's
like if you're working on your website
and then you want to
do some random search after, you're just
wasting tokens if it's a a completely
separate task. Uh so this is something
that is kind of a UX
new UX problem of like when do you
switch to a new chat? Do you let users
decide? Do you use LLMs to decide? And
that's still an area that we're thinking
about.
>> Yeah, good point of view.
Okay, we have two more questions left.
Uh the presentation covers the benefits
of caching well. Can you please touch on
the downsides to overly relying on
caching for value maxing?
>> Uh
>> I I can I can say a few words.
>> Um
yeah, like
we like I think Charlie's portion was a
great overview of like
all the tools.
Um I definitely did more of a deep dive
into caching. So this is assuming that
you're like
you've you've already done a little bit
of an audit of all your traces and say
like oh, this tool call is outputting
way too many tokens. Um or you're like
duplicating
um outputs in the in the context window
or you are
making the agent do stuff that it
doesn't need to do, that you could just
write code for.
Um so that all comes down to just
basics of um like auditing the traces of
what your agent is doing. Um and then
once you've done, you know, uh
the 80% of the job there, then you can
you can definitely get a lot of value
from the caching side.
>> Nice.
>> Yeah, I think the only thing I'd add is
is, you know,
um
caching as a general concept, right? I
think it like it is often very
beneficial, but um you want to introduce
it when you're ready for it. I think
when you feel like you have a good grip
on like the the parts of the application
that will benefit, otherwise you can get
brittle, right? And you can you can feel
a little bit hamstrung.
>> Awesome. Thanks. Okay, last question
before we wrap up. Does Compact run
differently on different models and
reasoning levels?
>> Uh the underlying endpoint should work
should work the same, right? And I think
like with different models, um you know,
essentially uh there's some secret
sauce, so I can't talk about everything
here, but uh essentially we're taking
the um
the history of the conversation and
turning it into like uh a representation
that the model can can understand and
reuse in the future. Um and uh
that, you know, depending on the model
and the reasoning level, um
you know,
what gets encoded maybe maybe slightly
different, but that also depends on the
chat, right? And so I think like uh you
would expect um
as a mechanism, it it runs the the same,
but, you know, per chat the the outputs
might be a little bit different.
>> Okay, awesome. Lorenzo, Bryant, thanks
so much for joining us, um especially on
the Q&A, super insightful, and I think a
lot of um the startup founders and and
developers um really appreciated it.
So, to wrap up, here are some resources.
Um first and foremost, GPT 5.6 blog, um
programmatic tool calling guide, um
compare models, um and Cohere's uh
migrating a production AI agent um
uh blog. And then a couple of people
asked in the post actually about your
demo and if you can try it themselves.
So the answer is yes. Our all the code
that we use for build hours is shared on
our build our repo. So feel free to
check it out. And as I mentioned
earlier, we're going to post all of this
on demand, send out an email with all of
these links. So don't worry too much
about copying all of this down.
Next we have our upcoming build hour on
July 29th. This one's going to be on
ImageGen 2. So you'll learn the latest
on that. And as always, copy down this
link. We're constantly posting new
sessions. Feel free also to reach out if
you have any ideas on what you want to
hear next. And with that, thanks so
much. And we'll see you next time.
>> Thanks, everybody.
