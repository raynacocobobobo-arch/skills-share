Skills and MCP servers are making agents
more capable, and
plugins give developers a way to package
those capabilities so
they can be shared and reused.
But today, every agent product expects a
different manifest, folder structure,
and setup process.
That's why contributors from AWS,
Cursor, GitHub, Microsoft, OpenAI,
and Vercel came together to create
Agent Plugins, an open, vendor-neutral
way to package extensions for agents.
One format for people building plugins,
and one predictable way for agent tools
to find them. At its simplest,
an agent plugin is just a folder,
with a manifest called plugin.json at
the root. This first release focuses on
two things developers already use,
agent skills for reusable instructions
and workflows, and MCP servers,
which connect agents to tools and
data. You can put these resources in the
standard locations, and
the same package is much easier to
support across different products.
For plugin authors,
the payoff is less platform-specific
glue and one version format to build
against. Agent products can support
skills, MCPs, or both, and
extend the format without changing its
portable core. This spec standardizes
packaging and discovery,
not marketplaces, permissions, or
runtimes. Agent Plugins is open and
ready to build with. Package your
capability, add support in your product,
and go check it out yourself.
