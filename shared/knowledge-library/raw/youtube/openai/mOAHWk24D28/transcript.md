This has been a really awesome way to do
forecasting. It saves a lot of time to
do more strategic forward-looking
analysis or initiatives for our finance
team. Hey everyone, I'm Jackson. I'm on
the data science team here at OpenAI,
but I work really, really closely with
the strategic finance team and it's
really exciting to talk to you a little
bit about how we do forecasting here at
OpenAI. All the folks on the call on the
finance teams, every single
month you can imagine the beginning of
the month scramble where you're waiting
for the data to land, you're updating
your spreadsheets, you're trying to talk
to the product team, the marketing team,
the go-to-market team of like how you
should be updating your forecast. You're
trying to build a really solid forecast
that you can present to the CFO. I think
everyone kind of feels that scramble.
It's no different here at OpenAI,
but we're always asking ourselves how
can we make this process better? So, the
problem we want to solve was to build
something like an interactive UI that we
could send over to our finance partners,
work with them collaboratively
and ultimately update our forecast. The
first thing I did was
I'm prompting I'm prompting chat to say
Hey, let's kick off this monthly
forecast.
Pull the latest actuals, update our data
science baseline, and build an
interactive finance forecast using
sites. Sites is basically a way for
anyone to kind of build a website with
no code, host it without any
infrastructure, and it's something we
use a lot internally. Let's see what it
came up with. We see the data science
baseline, we see our prior forecast, and
we see a kind of a scenario we can
build. And this is all at the aggregate
level right here.
I have a visual representation of this
as well, so I can kind of see if the
trends are looking like, you know,
eyeball the trends to see what we're
what we're thinking for the next half of
the year.
And then um I've also asked it to look
account by account so I can make kind of
adjustments by account. And
this this site has a feature to go down
every account, but let's look at Apex,
one of our larger accounts.
So, we can kind of see the baseline
here.
And then we can kind of see this green
line here that we can actually adjust
directly in the UI.
Which is super cool.
And what's happening right now is it's
although it's updating the forecast for
this account, the entire model is
updating in the background, so the
aggregate number also gets adjusted.
