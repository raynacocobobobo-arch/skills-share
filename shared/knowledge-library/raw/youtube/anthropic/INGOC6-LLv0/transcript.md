Most people who use software every day don't think about bugs.
They don't think about what can happen if the software
that they depend upon suddenly is less secure.
That's something that software developers have to deal with every single day.
Software has always had flaws and vulnerabilities.
That's not new.
For an average person, the bugs are, by and large,
not something they notice on a daily basis, because if they do,
they get fixed.
But then every so often, there are vulnerabilities
that have real severe impacts.
Like one single bug that works its way into shared software
that many, many, many different products or websites use.
One issue just gets magnified out around the world.
Historically, finding and patching vulnerabilities
has been a slow, time-consuming, and expensive process.
If LLMs are now able to write code, at the level of some of the greatest
software developers in the world,
it can also be used to find bugs
and exploit that software equally effectively.
These models have capabilities which are raising the bar
from a cybersecurity point of view
with their ability to help defenders as well as potentially help adversaries.
We recently developed a new model, Claude Mythos Preview.
Early on, it was clear to us that this model
was going to be meaningfully better at cybersecurity capabilities.
There's a high accelerating exponential, but along that exponential,
there are points of significance.
Claude Mythos Preview is a particularly big jump
along that point.
We haven't trained it specifically to be good at cyber.
We trained it to be good at code, but as a side effect
of being good at code, it's also good at cyber.
The model that we're experimenting with is by and large as good
as a professional human at identifying bugs.
It's good for us because we can find
more vulnerabilities sooner and we can fix them.
It has the ability to chain together vulnerabilities.
What this means is you find two vulnerabilities,
either of which doesn't really get you very much independently,
but this model is able to create exploits out of three, four,
sometimes five vulnerabilities that in sequence
give you some very sophisticated end outcome.
And we think that this model can do this really well
because we noticed that this model is very autonomous.
It's just generally better at pursuing really long-range tasks
that are kind of like the tasks that a human security researcher
would do throughout the course of an entire day.
Obviously, capabilities in a model like this could do harm
if in the wrong hands,
and so we won't be releasing this model widely.
More powerful models are going to come from us and from others,
and so we do need a plan to respond to this.
That's why we're launching what we're calling Project Glasswing,
where we partner with a number of the organizations
that power some of the world's most critical code
to put the model into their hands to allow them
to look at how they can use models like this to bring down risk
and protect everyone.
And by giving these software developers
advanced tools before anyone else,
it gives all of us a collective headstart.
It allows us to find things that we couldn't find before,
and it helps us fix these things much more quickly.
Working with our partners, we've been finding vulnerabilities
across essentially every major platform.
I found more bugs in the last couple of weeks than I found
in the rest of my life combined.
We used the model to scan a bunch of open-source code
and the thing that we went for first was operating systems
because this is the code that underlies
the entire internet infrastructure.
For OpenBSD, we found a bug that's been present
for 27 years, where I can send a couple of pieces of data
to any OpenBSD server and crash it.
On Linux, we found a number of vulnerabilities
where, as a user with no permissions, I can elevate myself to the administrator
by just running some binary on my machine.
For each of these bugs, we told the maintainers
who actually run the software about them, and they went and fixed them
and have deployed the patches so that anyone who runs this software
is no longer vulnerable to these attacks.
For a developer who tirelessly maintains software,
a model that can help them discover vulnerabilities in their own code
and fix them before they can be exploited,
that is an invaluable tool.
We've spoken to officials across the US government,
and we've offered to work with them and collaborate to assess the risks
of these models and to help defend against the risks of these models.
Everything that we do in our lives now depends on software.
Software ate the world.
Every analog aspect of our life is somehow represented in the digital domain.
And so all of our daily lives run on the idea that we can rely on
the systems that power them.
Cybersecurity is the security of our society.
It is essential that we come together and work together across industry
to help build better defensive capabilities.
No single organization sees the whole picture
and can tackle this on their own.
This is not going to be done as part of a few week program.
This is going to be the work of certainly months, perhaps years.
But what I do hope is at the end of this,
we can be in a position where the world's software,
its customer data, its financial transactions,
its critical infrastructure are safer than they were before.
